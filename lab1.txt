Q2:
The memory address of main function for the kernel is 0xffffffff801037a9.
GDB works with virtual address because this address number is too big for real physical address.

Q3:
They map into the same address space so that the kernelâ€™s system call code can directly refer to user memory.
Also, the kernel must allocate and free physical memory at run-time for page tables, process user memory, kernel stacks, and pipe buffers.
The switch between user space and kernel space becomes more efficient.

Q4.1:
xk user malloc allocates physically fragmented memory area with specified size on the Heap.
xk kernel malloc allocates physical contiguous memory at run-time for page tables, process user memory, kernel stacks, and pipe buffers, which allocates whole 4096-byte pages at a time.

Q4.2:
xk user printf prints to the given file descriptor.
xk kernel printf prints to the console.

Q9:
I like this lab because it helped me to review the knowledge from class and also be familiar to debug use gdb. However, it's time consuming. How to debug in gdb.
